# MESA PreBuilt Libraries

The Binaries in this folder are compiled from a custom version of [MESA](https://github.com/aerisarn/mesa-uwp). 
These are based on this [branch](https://github.com/aerisarn/mesa-uwp/tree/alpha-2-hack-fixes), which is the
stable branch for MESA integration into Retroarch.

Vulkan support via vulkan\_dzn is experimental and highly limited but may open a few new doors.  See this [branch](https://github.com/worleydl/mesa-uwp/tree/unleash_the_vulkan).  See this [website](https://mesamatrix.net/) to get an idea of how dzn stacks up to other drivers.
